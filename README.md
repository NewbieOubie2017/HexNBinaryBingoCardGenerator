# HexNBinaryBingoCardGenerator
For teachers/students of math or computer science this program generates nice looking Bingo Cards with hexadecimal and/or Binary numbers with or without a free space in the middle.
This program requires python 3 and tkinter and turtle, I hope it helps some teachers and students learn CS, Hex and Bin.

here is the input line and output from python IDLE:  NOTE i could only print out the cards as .ps not png as I desired.
